 *  @section  Introduction
 *            This C++ project realizes a common traffic light, like it is used on the streets.
 *            The project language is english.
 *
 *  @section  Basics
 *            There are two operating states: active and flashing (Standby). It can be switched between these states.
 *            But it also can be switched between Softwareinput and -output and Hardwareinput and -output.
 *            To switch between states there are state patterns. The concrete states of these state machines are implemented as singelton pattern.
